=head1 Operators

Pass operators to functions, for example (pseudo-code):

=begin code cpp

    apply ((+), 2, 3) == 5;
  where
    long operator+ (long, long);
    long apply (long (@f)(long, long), long v1, long v2)
    { return f (v1, v2); }

=end code cpp

For this, operator stubs need to be generated.

Parse things like C<< a-&gt;[3] >> into C<(*a)[3]>.
