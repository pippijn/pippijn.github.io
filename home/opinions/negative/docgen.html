Why not to use documentation generators</h2>
<ul></ul><p>
The Java programming language has a specification for code documentation called
"JavaDoc". Many C and C++ programmers use tools such as
<a href='http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/'>Doxygen</a> to automatically generate code
documentation with inheritance- and callgraphs. These tools are often praised
and are said to force programmers to write useful documentation. This is a
document on why such tools are overrated and overused.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Annoying<p>
I think that often, documentation tools force programmers to get annoyed at the
tools due to them expecting documentation for self-explaining functions.  See
<a href='why-not-use_java.xhtml#javadoc'>Why not to use Java</a> for a good example of
useless documentation. Java's CheckStyle utility requires you to write such
silly comments. "double getX() returns the X coordinate of a point in double
precision. It also returns the X coordinate of a point". Just the fact that
CheckStyle requires you to write a description and an <span class='code'>@returns</span> directive
causes these redundant comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
Bloated documentation<p>
The tools generate large HTML pages with fancy links and graphs all over the
place, hiding the bits and pieces of valuable code documentation. In order to
still be visible, programmers tend to write even larger amounts of useless
chatter just to have a bit of content on those pages of wasted space. Good
examples of such chatter can be found in nearly every project that uses Doxygen.
Code samples, usage notes and every possible (even if obvious) situation is
explained in greatest detail. You might think this is a good thing, but what
happens is that the valuable pieces of information you might need are hidden
somewhere in a novel of code documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
Lazy<p>
Documentation generators, if they do not get the programmers to write
documentation for their code, makes those lazy. It may make them think they can
get away with writing no documentation and letting an automated tool generate
the docs for them. As a result, the produced documentation is entirely useless.
Everything such a tool can do can more or less easily be seen in the code
itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
Bad presentation<p>
Even if the idea of doclets in code is not that bad, the presentation of written
documentation is often very bad. As mentioned in the point on bloated
documentation, the HTML pages are huge and the documentation is barely visible.
This is a problem with the presentation of information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, I do not think that documentation systems such as JavaDoc or Doxygen
add to the value of code documentation. I have yet to see a library that I can
call well-documented by means of JavaDoc.</p>
