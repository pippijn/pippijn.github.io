			<h2>Experiences with Java Software Development

</h2> <p>I used to work at a small software company that primarily uses the Java
programming language for its development. While I have come to appreciate many
features of Java and its tooling, there are several things about the workflow I
am very unhappy about. On this page, I will describe some recent experience I
have had with web application development in Java.

</p> <h3>Development itself

</h3> <h4>Setting up the IDE

</h4> <p>Java development is usually done using the Eclipse platform and integrated
development environment. After downloading and extracting the Eclipse platform
for web developers, you need to install some plugins. For my current project (at
the time of writing), I needed five plugins. Installing them was no problem. One
of the plugins was Subclipse, another was m2eclipse, the Maven integration for
the IDE. It all went well, so far. The whole process took about two hours, but
that's no problem. Setting up the development environment for C++ or any other
language will take roughly the same amount of time.

</p> <h4>Importing the project

</h4> <p>I had already worked on a project, which I now wanted to import into my new
Eclipse, so I checked it out via the 
  <code>svn</code> command line tool. Then I imported
it into Eclipse using the m2eclipse feature 
  <em>Import existing Maven project</em>.
That, too, went well. The project appeared in my project explorer and it started
compiling it, right away. And this is when the fun part begins.


</p> <h4>Building the project

</h4> <p>The first time you want to build a project, Maven will download all the
dependencies and Maven plugins required to perform the requested action.
Compiling will download the "compile" plugin and execute it. Then, something
happened that should not have happened: the internet connection went down for a
few seconds, maybe half a minute, right when Maven was downloading dependencies.
The router sent back 
  <code>Network unreachable</code> ICMP packets, causing Maven to skip
that download and try the next one. It took just a moment for Maven to have
tried all 65 dependencies it still had to fetch. When the connection was
re-established, I wanted it to continue the build, so I did a "clean" on the
project, hoping it would then continue downloading.


</p> <p>Instead of downloading the rest of the packages, I got 65 messages that roughly
stated "Could not download package $package:$name:$version for the reason
'Network unreachable'. Will not re-attempt to download it unless the update site
expires or an update is forced."

</p> <p>My poor Eclipse was deeply traumatised by not being able to download something.
From now on, it will 
  <strong>never</strong> try to download those things, anymore. It is too
afraid the horrible "Network unreachable" packet will come again. It's like
"Dear diary, on May 25th, the internet connection was gone and the router said
bad words to me :'("


</p> <p>Having spent 4 hours downloading and configuring Eclipse and all the plugins, I
did not want to do it all over again, so I seeked alternative solutions. The
only viable solutions I could come up with was: using the Maven command line
tool 
  <code>mvn</code>. And this is where things went really well. I typed "mvn compile"
and it compiled. I typed "mvn package" and I got a packaged version of my
project. Everything went smoothly. Afterwards, Eclipse's Maven was also happier,
because the missing packages were now installed. However, it was still missing
the surefire test plugin, which the CLI Maven had installed, but at a different
version, because the CLI one was more recent than the one integrated with
Eclipse. This plugin was impossible to download, because Eclipse was still
traumatised, so I had to go to the update site and download the four files (jar,
pom and their respective sha1 sum files) by hand and put them into my local
Maven repository.


</p> <h4>Starting new projects

</h4> <p>One of my coworkers recently gave me the following advice: "When you have
multiple projects with different toolset requirements, you should have one
Eclipse installation per project. If you try to cram all the plugins needed for
all your projects into one Eclipse, it will become so slow it's not funny,
anymore." In other words, for each project, I need a 300MB IDE along with
100-200MB of plugins. Of course, the whole process described above is initially
required before actual development can begin. He also said, it's no problem to
maintain several Eclipses in parallel. I don't completely agree.

</p> <p>Imagine having started a project after spending an entire nine-to-five working
day setting up the IDE. I tend to work on a project with great motivation for a
while and then to completely forget about it for several months, maybe even a
year. If I want to continue working on it with an up-to-date toolset, I don't
need to bother updating Eclipse. Instead, I have to reinstall the whole thing,
because when 3.7 comes out, 3.6 is "the oldest piece of crap on earth, must be
from the stone age". After you spent another day installing the IDE with
plugins, you will find that all the configuration files have slightly changed
their format, so you'll need to manually adapt those, as well, so when updating,
you'll probably spend two days instead of one, because you need to adapt the
files you gradually configured to your needs while developing the project a year
ago.

</p> <h4>Installing a library not in the Maven repository

</h4> <p>Installing dependencies is very easy, if the library is in the Maven repository.
If you need an up-to-date version of it, it's also not so hard: you download the
new source package and do 
  <code>mvn install</code> in its project root (alternatively, you
import it in Eclipse and spend several orders of magnitude more time on it). If
the package doesn't use Maven, it probably uses ant. That is all fine, you can
build a jar with ant and use that from Eclipse. However, if you are not the only
one who works on the project or you want to employ a continuous integration
system such as the Hudson build server, you will need to write a Maven POM
(Project Object Model) file. This is an XML file that is probably not going to
be less than a few hundred lines long. Nice and easy, right? Oh yes, you also
need your own non-local Maven repository to store the new package in.


</p> <h4>Solving a problem

</h4> <p>When something suddenly doesn't work anymore in a Java web development
environment, these are the steps you follow:

</p> <ul>
  <li>Clean all projects and rebuild the workspace.
  
  </li>
  <li>Clean the tomcat server.
  
  </li>
  <li>Restart the tomcat server, in case you had the crazy idea to reload it, instead.
  
  </li>
  <li>Delete the tomcat server and add it again and all servlets you may have had.
  
  </li>
  <li>Clean again. If it didn't work, clean again. Repeat until it works or you're fed up with it.
  
  </li>
  <li>Restart Eclipse.
  
  </li>
  <li>Clean again.
  
  </li>
  <li>Delete the project and re-import it (I hope you are using Maven).
  
  </li>
  <li>Search the internet for the error message you got.
  
  </li>
  <li>If none of that worked, reinstall Eclipse, and delete your workspace along with all its settings.
  
  </li>
</ul> <p>Indeed, most common problems are solved after a few cleans. That's the sad part.
One clean might not suffice, so just do it twice. Maybe restart the IDE and
clean again, that might work. While Java has no undefined behaviour in the
language itself, the tools are supremely unpredictable.

</p> <p>This all takes time. This all takes 
  <em>much</em> time. It takes so much time during
which I can not write code that it's annoying. In fact, I think that the
productivity lost in should-be needless cleans and restarts is so much that the
productivity gained by being able to write code with a few keystrokes less than
with a normal editor does not make up for it.


</p> <p>On a side note, tomcat reloading usually works, but sometimes doesn't. You will
learn, after using it for some time, after roughly how many reloads the server
will be broken. You will learn that restarting it by hand before that time is
faster than waiting for it to die when broken. You will note that a broken
tomcat in Eclipse might just hose your IDE completely, requiring a restart.

</p> <h3>Working with other Java developers

</h3> <p>People are generally very convinced of the technology they use. Be it a car, a
phone or a programming language. Programmers are no different and one of the
demigods Java developers worship is Eclipse (another is Maven).

</p> <h4>Java developers' view of Java

</h4> <p>In the above two paragraphs, I described some positive and negative sides of
working with C++ and automake. My main issue with Java developers is their
complete lack of objectivity. Java and, by extension, Eclipse and Maven, are
tools brought into being by the lord himself and are perfect in every form (yes,
I am exaggerating a little, but it's almost like this). This is what I heard so
many times from my coworkers:

</p> <ul>
  <li>With Eclipse and Maven, everything is so easy.
  
  
    <p>No, not really. Read up.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>With Eclipse and Maven, you don't need to mess with configuration files.
  
  
    <p>Yes, you do, and it's worse than with 
      <code>make</code>, because you're not supposed to
    meddle with them, so tools that operate on those files may mess up your
    customisations.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>I don't want to write my own makefiles, I want to write code.
  
  
    <p>The thing is, if you do write your own makefiles, fixing a problem is much
    easier, because you're used to it. Fixing a problem in Eclipse or Maven takes
    hours, because you have to seek help on the internet with people who already
    went through the tens of XML files you may need to modify.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h3>Final thoughts

</h3> <p>I do like some aspects of Java and I do dislike some aspects of C++, but one
should always use the tool that best fits the job. Furthermore, one should know
the limitations and negative sides of the tools at hand, not deny them. That is
what makes a tool user a tool zealot.

</p> <p>Enjoy your experience with Java.
