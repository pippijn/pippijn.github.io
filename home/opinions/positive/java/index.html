Why to use Java</h2>
<ul></ul><p>
This is a list of arguments why to use Java.</p>
<ul>
<li>
JVM<a id='jvm'></a><p>
The Java Virtual Machine as distributed by Sun Microsystems is a mature piece
of software. It can optimise code on the fly based on runtime performance. On
loading a class, the HotSpot VM statically binds methods that do not require
the virtual call mechanism. When it notices a function is called a lot from a
certain location, it inlines that function in that location. This mechanism
allows a Java server to become faster over time, even if its initial
performance was not so great. This also means that it is a good idea to leave
your Eclipse platform on forever, because it becomes more and more usable.</p>
</li>
<li>
Large class library<a id='library'></a><p>
The Java class library consists of a huge amount of heavily documented code.
It contains I/O, networking, GUI, XML processing, cryptography, databases,
logging facilities and much more. The graphics library allows for almost
platform-independent GUI development.</p>
</li>
<li>
Pretty much platform-independent<a id='platform'></a><p>
The nature of byte-code compiled languages is that they are portable to any
platform you can write an interpreter on. Not all components of Java are
equally portable and the bytecode may not be equally fast on all platforms,
but in theory, the same piece of binary code can be used on any platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
Simple bytecode<a id='bytecode'></a><p>
The Java bytecode is so simple that even hardware microprocessors are capable
of natively executing it. There used to be Motorola microchips in cell phones
that could execute Java bytecode natively. This meant that you could write a
Java application on your desktop computer and execute it directly on the CPU
of your cell phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
Fast compiler<a id='compiler'></a><p>
Compared to C++, Java compiles very fast, because there is little optimisation
required at compile time. All heavy optimisation is delayed until runtime.
The fast compiler leads to short development cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
Industry uses it a lot<a id='industry'></a><p>
Java is the de-facto standard for server-side web programming together with
PHP. Learning Java will give you more chance getting a job. Another effect of
industrial use is that it has many users and therefore a high absolute number
of skilled programmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
Garbage collection<a id='gc'></a><p>
Garbage collection makes memory management easier. You do not need to make
sure memory you use is freed when no longer used. The garbage collector takes
care of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
Third party software<a id='thirdparty'></a><p>
Due to Java's high position in the most used languages list (it currently has
about 20% market share), many people decide to write their software in it.
The Apache Foundation has a large amount of open source code written in Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
Good IDEs due to reflection<a id='ide'></a><p>
Java, being a reflective language, offers language support for writing
excellent Integrated Development Environments such as Eclipse. Even
implementing code completion in editors such as VIM becomes nearly trivial
using the reflective features of the language:</p>
<div class='centered-image'><div><img src='javavim.png' alt=''/></div></div></li>
<li>
Good support for concurrency<a id='concurrency'></a><p>
Java has native support for threading. This support is either missing or
insufficiently mature in most other languages. Due to the the Java locking
system, it can perform very fast locking and unlocking of threadlocks. This is
achieved by not using mutices for everything. On Linux, Java uses the
<span class='code'>futex(2)</span> system call, which provides fast userspace locking.</p>
</li>
<li>
High abstraction<a id='abstraction'></a><p>
It is easy to create a high level of abstraction through the use of interfaces
and subclasses. For example, you can expect a <span class='code'>List&lt;T&gt;</span> in a method and
let the user decide whether they want to give you an <span class='code'>ArrayList</span>, a <span class='code'>Vector</span>
or a <span class='code'>LinkedList</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
Type-safety<a id='typesafe'></a><p>
Java is type-safe, which means it can catch many aliasing errors at
compile-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
Real module system<a id='modules'></a><p>
As opposed to C++, Java has a real module system, making header files
obsolete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
