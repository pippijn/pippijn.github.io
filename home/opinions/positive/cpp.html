			<h2>Why to use C++

</h2> <p>These are a few arguments why to use C++.

</p> <ul>
  <li>High performance (@performance)
  
  
    <p>C++ can be very fast. It can be very lightweight and execute code with very
    high performance. Also, modern compilers do an excellent job on optimising
    code. They can generate assembler code specific to a processor and optimise
    for specific branch predictors or even models of branch predictors.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Little magic (@nomagic)
  
  
    <p>The only things magical in C++ are the operators on built-in types. The
    operators on strings such as less-than comparison, equality comparison and
    assignment are all well-defined in the C++ standard library. They can be
    inspected and modified at will. It would be even nicer if it were possible to
    override the operators for built-in types within certain classes or namespaces.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Pragmatic (@pragmatic)
  
  
    <p>Being a multi-paradigm language, C++ adapts to real-world problems with fairly
    little effort. Functional programming can be achieved with function pointers,
    upcoming lambda expressions (which are currently emulated with function-local
    classes). Object oriented is built in using classes and full inheritance.
    Procedural programming is done with functions.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Flexible (@flexible)
  
  
    <p>With sufficient effort, it can be made to do almost anything any other
    language can do. This effort may be enormous, but it is possible.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Unrestrictive (@unrestrictive)
  
  
    <p>Many see this as a negative aspect of a language, but in C++ you are able to
    force your machine into doing exactly what you want. You are not limited by
    the language, only by your skill and imagination. Even though you may only
    abuse the language in a very small area (my 
      <code>hash_table</code> implementation
    abuses C++ in exactly one line), this small amount of abuse may be essential
    for performance (that single line makes the code much more efficient).
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Easy to interface with other languages (@interop)
  
  </li>
  <li>Templates (@templates)
  
  
    <p>The C++ 
      <code>template</code> system is a very powerful code generator.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Choices (@choices)
  
  
    <p>Instead of enforcing checks, C++ allows optional checking for runtime errors
    such as invalid array accesses, buffer overflows, invalid pointer dereferences
    and more. These checks slow down the program in the same way automatically
    checked languages like Java are slowed down. The difference is that in C++
    you have the choice.
    
    </p>
    <p>This is one of the main strengths of C++: it leaves many things open to the
    programmer. They can choose to use automatic memory management or to manually
    free all used memory. They can decide where to store the created objects.
    Choices include the stack, the heap and a specialised object allocator.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Standard library is to the point (@stdlib)
  
  
    <p>The C++ standard library is much more limited than the Java class library, but
    it is much more to the point. It provides tools that are used in almost any
    program. Features include data structures, algorithms, streams and simple
    template metaprogramming tools. The GNU C++ library is 7MB which is tiny compared
    to the 105MB of the Java class library. This limited set of features make C++
    much more portable than Java. C++ can be implemented on platforms that provide
    no graphical user interface. While the Java core language can be implemented
    on such platforms, the class library can't.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Operator overloading (@operators)
  
  
    <p>This is a very important feature and is used to create algorithms that operate
    on pointers and primitive arrays as well as classes. It also allows us to
    create used defined datatypes that act like built-in types. With C++, it is
    possible to define a 
      <code>rational</code> class that has all mathematical operators
    defined and can be used just like a normal floating point number.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple inheritance (@mi)
  
  
    <p>Although arguably a bad feature, multiple inheritance makes many things a lot
    easier. It can be abused, but it can also be used right. An example I can give
    here is inheritance to gain memory allocation semantics. For instance, if you
    write a high performance slice allocator that defines 
      <code>operator new</code> and
    
      <code>delete</code>, inheriting from it will make the class automatically and
    transparently allocated using this slice allocator:
    
    
    </p>
    <code>to be filled</code>
    <p>Here, multiple inheritance is required to inherit the code from the allocator
    as well as the code from 
      <code>node_base</code>. Things like that would not be possible
    with single inheritance.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Scoped resource management (@raii)
  
  
    <p>This allows for the RAII design pattern. It acquires a resource when
    initialising an object and releases it when destroying the object. See the
    
      <a href="why-not-use_java.xhtml#raii">Why not to use Java</a> page for an example.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>const</code>-correctness
  
  
    <p>C++ can, using the 
      <code>const</code> keyword, help the programmer prevent modification
    to unwritable objects. This can prevent accidental modification of actual
    read-only data such as string literals but also indicate what a programmer may
    do with an object. As always, there are ways to work around the constness of
    an object using 
      <code>const_cast</code> but that is rarely a good idea and may result in
    
      <a href="why-not-use_cpp.xhtml#ub">undefined behaviour</a>. Member functions marked
    
      <code>const</code> indicate that those functions do not modify the data structure they
    operate on. This is both documenting and error preventing. Using top-level
    
      <code>const</code> on function parameters prevents assignment of such (and therefore
    works like Java's 
      <code>final</code> keyword).
    
    
    </p>
    <p>The 
      <code>const</code> keyword helps the design-by-contract strategy.
