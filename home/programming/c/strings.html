			<h2>String representations in C

</h2> <h3>What is a string?

</h3> <p>That is a very important question. Most programmers think that strings
represent text. This is not the real meaning of the word 'string'. Text is
usually represented by a 
  <em>byte string</em>, but does not have to be. It may as
well be represented by an octet string or a 32 bit integer string.


</p> <h3>Different representations

</h3> <h4>NUL terminated

</h4> <p>This is the representation most commonly used in the C programming language.
All string literals are NUL terminated. C has two kinds of string literals:
character and wide character string literals. The latter is written

  <code>L"text"</code> and is of type 
  <code>wchar_t const*</code>. The representation in memory of

  <code>"text"</code> would be equivalent to:


</p> <pre class="verbatim">{ 't', 'e', 'x', 't', 0 }
// In ASCII values:
{ 0x74, 0x65, 0x78, 0x74, 0 }
// In EBCDIC values:
{ 0xa3, 0x85, 0xa7, 0xa3, 0 }</pre> <p>
  <code>L"text"</code>'s representation is even more platform dependent and could be:


</p> <pre class="verbatim">{ L't', L'e', L'x', L't', 0 }
// In ASCII values:
{ 0x0074, 0x0065, 0x0078, 0x0074, 0 }</pre> <p>This is not surprising. More surprising would be the representation of

  <code>"&#x263a;"</code> and 
  <code>L"&#x263a;"</code>:


</p> <pre class="verbatim">"&#x263a;"
{ 0x3f, 0x98, 0xba, 0 }
L"&#x263a;"
{ 0x263a, 0 }</pre> <p>The former is the UTF-8 octet-representation of the smiley face, the latter is
the Unicode code point in a 
  <code>wchar_t</code> string. This is all highly platform
dependent and could be all different for you. This text, however, is not about
platform dependentness of string literals. It is about how strings can be
represented in memory.


</p> <h5>Advantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Low memory consumption
  
  
    <p>There is no need to store the length of a string anywhere, because that can be
    found easily by iterating over the characters and increment a counter until a
    NUL character is found.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>C standard library compatible
  
  
    <p>The C standard library functions operate on such NUL terminated strings, so
    conversion is not required.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h5>Disadvantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Cannot hold NUL characters
  
  
    <p>Due to this string depending on the special NUL character denoting its end, it
    cannot contain NUL characters itself. A string like 
      <code>"Hello\0World"</code> would be
    interpreted as 
      <code>"Hello"</code>.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h4>struct string

</h4> <p>A more sophisticated string representation is the following struct, frequently
used by C++'s 
  <code>std::string</code> implementations:


</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">struct</span> string
{
  <span class="Type">char</span> *rep;
  <span class="Type">size_t</span> len;
  <span class="Type">size_t</span> max;
};
</pre> <p>
  <code>string.rep</code> is the internal representation of the string, which is just a
data pointer and not necessarily a NUL terminated C string. 
  <code>len</code> holds the
current length and 
  <code>max</code> is the number of bytes this string can hold before
it needs a reallocation.


</p> <h5>Advantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Can hold any binary data
  
  
    <p>This string does not depend on special characters marking its end, so it can
    hold such characters without any problem.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Constant time strlen
  
  
    <p>The 
      <code>strlen</code> equivalent for this string runs in constant time, because the
    string maintains a variable holding the length.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h5>Disadvantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Not standard library compatible
  
  
    <p>In order to use C standard library functions such as 
      <code>strcat</code> or 
      <code>printf</code>,
    this string needs to be converted to a NUL terminated C string. That can be
    done either by copying the string and omitting NUL characters or by making
    sure the string is at least NUL terminated and ignoring inner NUL characters.
    C++'s 
      <code>std::string</code> chose to do the latter.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h4>Netstring

</h4> <p>
  <a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt">Netstrings</a> are strings in the form


</p> <pre class="verbatim">[length]":"[string]","</pre> <p>They are stored in octet strings.

</p> <h5>Advantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Can hold any binary data
  
  
    <p>Just like the 
      <code>struct string</code> above, this string stores its size along with
    the data.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Almost constant time strlen
  
  
    <p>Finding the length of a Netstring is as easy as finding the ':' in the string
    and converting the text before it to an integer.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Can be sent over network without conversions
  
  
    <p>This string does not use byte order dependent data, so it can be sent and
    received verbatim over network.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h5>Disadvantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>High memory consumption
  
  
    <p>This string stores the string representation of the length, which may need up
    to 11 bytes of memory in addition to the ':' and ',', so up to 13 bytes are
    spent on the length only.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h4>String with size prepended

</h4> <p>This is a 
  <code>char*</code> object that looks just like any normal C string, except
that it has a hidden size prepended to it. In memory, a "Hello" string would
look like this:


</p> <pre class="verbatim">// Big endian ASCII
0x00, 0x05, 0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f
// Little endian ASCII
0x05, 0x00, 0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f</pre> <p>The pointer actually points at the third character, so the length is hidden
from normal functions and only the special functions that destructively
operate on the string's representation know about its existence.

</p> <h5>Advantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Low memory consumption
  
  
    <p>This string type only takes 2 extra octets of memory to be able to represent
    any string up to a length of 65535 characters.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Can hold any binary data
  
  
    <p>Like the Netstring, this string prepends its length to its actual data, which
    allows the string to hold any string of characters, including NUL.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Constant time strlen
  
  
    <p>The length is known and already in host integer representation, so finding the
    length is a constant time operation.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Standard library compatible
  
  
    <p>As long as no NUL characters exist within the string, it can be passed to
    standard library functions such as strcmp, making many operations on this type
    of string trivial.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h5>Disadvantages

</h5> <ul>
  <li>Length stored in host byte order
  
  
    <p>If you want to send this string over a network channel, the size needs to be
    converted to network byte order, unless the host is big endian. The string is
    therefore slightly harder to handle.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <p>Note that you can prepend anything to the actual string data, as long as you
remember the offset. This technique is commonly used in hashed strings that
contain their own hash code, making getting the hash value a constant time
operation.

</p> <p>If you do it smartly, you can minimise storage overhead by storing up to 0x7f
in the last byte and look at the previous byte if it is greater than 0x7f. If
the previous byte is also greater than 0x7f, proceed with the next previous
byte, and so on. For further details, see the wikipedia article on
