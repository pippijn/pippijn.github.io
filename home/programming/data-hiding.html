			<h2>Information hiding

</h2> <p>This text is about the principle known as 
  <em>information hiding</em>, 
  <em>data hiding</em>
or (not entirely correctly) 
  <em>encapsulation</em>. In our examples, we use the C
programming language, because it fits the principle best of all. This is a bit
ironic, because C of all languages widely used today is, assembly language not
counted, said to be the least object oriented language.


</p> <h3>Introduction

</h3> <ul>
  <li>Client code
  
  
    <p>is all the code that uses the data types and operations defined on them but
    does not operate on the internal structures of those types.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Information hiding
  
  
    <p>is a principle of hiding implementation details from client code. This is
    achieved by writing accessor functions as required.
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <p>A simple example of information hiding would be a string object:

</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">struct</span> string
{
  <span class="Type">char</span> *rep;
  <span class="Type">size_t</span> len;
  <span class="Type">size_t</span> capacity.
};</pre> <p>This 
  <code>struct</code> knows its length and has a data pointer pointing at the
in-memory string representation. It also knows its maximum capacity, so it can
allocate more memory on demand. In order to avoid corruption of the internal
state (in this case, the len member), we write accessor functions, for
example:


</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">size_t</span> strLength (<span class="Type">struct</span> string <span class="Type">const</span> *str);
<span class="Type">char</span> <span class="Type">const</span> *strToCStr (<span class="Type">struct</span> string <span class="Type">const</span> *str);
<span class="Type">char</span> strCharAt (<span class="Type">struct</span> string <span class="Type">const</span> *str, <span class="Type">size_t</span> pos);
<span class="Type">void</span> strSetCharAt (<span class="Type">struct</span> string *str, <span class="Type">size_t</span> pos, <span class="Type">char</span> c);
<span class="Type">void</span> strAddChars (<span class="Type">struct</span> string *str, <span class="Type">char</span> <span class="Type">const</span> *chars);</pre> <p>These functions operate on the data structure declared above. Functions
that take a pointer-to-const promise not to modify the structure.

</p> <p>Information hiding means to hide as much knowledge as possible. As part
of this, we could define new type aliases to hide the fact that a string
is represented by a pointer to a string structure:

</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">struct</span> string *String;
<span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">struct</span> string <span class="Type">const</span> *ConstString; <span class="Comment">// Immutable string</span></pre> <p>By doing this, we allow the representation to change at any time. For
example, we could choose to represent String objects by a simple data
pointer not knowing its size or a data pointer prepended by its size.

</p> <p class="small">
  <p>See &lt;a href="c/strings"&gt;C string representations&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in
  other string representations.
  
  </p>
</p> <p>Now, our accessor functions look like this:

</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">size_t</span> strLength (ConstString str);
<span class="Type">char</span> <span class="Type">const</span> *strToCStr (ConstString str);
<span class="Type">char</span> strCharAt (ConstString str, <span class="Type">size_t</span> pos);
<span class="Type">void</span> strSetCharAt (String str, <span class="Type">size_t</span> pos, <span class="Type">char</span> c);
<span class="Type">void</span> strAddChars (String str, <span class="Type">char</span> <span class="Type">const</span> *chars);</pre> <p>We did not only abstract away some knowledge, we also reduced our required
typing.

</p> <h3>Violations of the principle

</h3> <p>There are various more or less obvious ways to violate the principle of
information hiding. An obvious example would be directly accessing the
structure's members:

</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Comment">// Wrong:</span>
<span class="Type">void</span>
OnAdded (String str)
{
  strncat (str-&gt;rep, <span class="String">&quot; has been added&quot;</span>, str-&gt;capacity - str-&gt;len);
  str-&gt;len = strlen (str-&gt;rep);
}
<span class="Comment">// Right:</span>
<span class="Type">void</span>
OnAdded (String str)
{
  strAddChars (str, <span class="String">&quot; has been added&quot;</span>);
}</pre> <p>The function 
  <code>strAddChars</code> hides the knowledge about 
  <code>String</code>'s internal
structure and abstracts away the logic needed to add characters to the string.
The resulting code is more descriptive and less error prone. Instead of
kludging our own string concatenation operation every time, we write a single
testable function that does it for us. Our own version in "Wrong" truncates
the string, if it does not have enough room for the added text.


</p> <p>A less obvious violation of information hiding would be pointer operations on
String objects. Consider our String to be defined as 
  <code>char*</code>. This type
allows several operations that are built into C:


</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">char</span> *String;
<span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">char</span> <span class="Type">const</span> *ConstString;

<span class="Type">void</span>
someFunc (String str)
{
  printf (<span class="String">&quot;The second character is `</span><span class="SpecialChar">%d</span><span class="String">'</span><span class="SpecialChar">\n</span><span class="String">&quot;</span>, str[<span class="Number">1</span>]); <span class="Comment">// Index</span>
  str += <span class="Number">20</span>; <span class="Comment">// Addition</span>
  printf (<span class="String">&quot;The twenty-second character is `</span><span class="SpecialChar">%d</span><span class="String">'</span><span class="SpecialChar">\n</span><span class="String">&quot;</span>, str[<span class="Number">1</span>]); <span class="Comment">// Index</span>
  printf (<span class="String">&quot;The twenty-first character is `</span><span class="SpecialChar">%d</span><span class="String">'</span><span class="SpecialChar">\n</span><span class="String">&quot;</span>, *str); <span class="Comment">// Dereference</span>
  String newStr = str - <span class="Number">10</span>; <span class="Comment">// Subtracting integer</span>
  printf (<span class="String">&quot;The difference between newStr and str is </span><span class="SpecialChar">%d</span><span class="SpecialChar">\n</span><span class="String">&quot;</span>, newStr - str); <span class="Comment">// Pointer difference</span>
}</pre> <p>All these operations are defined on 
  <code>char*</code>, and therefore also on 
  <code>String</code>.
This does not have to be the case, though. If 
  <code>String</code> was defined as the

  <code>struct string*</code> earlier, all of these operations would cause a compilation
error. Using these operations requires knowledge about the internal
representation of 
  <code>String</code> and is therefore in violation of the information
hiding principle.


</p> <h3>Enforcing encapsulation in C

</h3> <p>C provides a very good way to enforce information hiding. We call this

  <em>opaque pointers</em>. Opaque in this sense means, we cannot touch or even 
  <em>see</em>
the internal structure. C allows us to 
  <em>forward declare</em> structures and pass
around pointers to them:


</p> <pre class="code-block"><span class="Type">struct</span> string;
<span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">struct</span> string *String;
<span class="Type">typedef</span> <span class="Type">struct</span> string <span class="Type">const</span> *ConstString;
<span class="Comment">// All of the above accessor functions still work</span>
<span class="Comment">// The OnAdded function marked with &quot;Right&quot; also still works, but the one</span>
<span class="Comment">//   marked &quot;Wrong&quot; will cause a compilation error</span></pre> <p>
  <code>String</code> is now what we call a 
  <em>pointer to an incomplete type</em>. Incomplete
means that it does exist as a type, but its representation is not known to the
compiler. Using opaque pointers is a good way of preventing direct member
access in client code.


</p> <h3>Advantages

</h3> <p>There are definite advantages of information hiding and those are good reasons
to apply it to your code.

</p> <ul>
  <li>Less changes in client code
  
  
    <p>If we change a name in a structure, for example if we wanted to rename our
    
      <code>len</code> to 
      <code>length</code>, because we think it is more descriptive, and client code
    depended on the variable being called 
      <code>len</code>, we will have to modify all that
    code. Automatic refactoring tools help, but none of them are perfect. If no
    client code depended on this fact, there is a lot less to modify with such a
    change. We inofficially call renamings like this 
      <em>API breakage</em>.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Faster recompilation and incremental builds
  
  
    <p>If you use a compiler cache such as 
      <a href="http://ccache.samba.org/">ccache</a> or if
    you use incremental build tools such as 
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>,
    you will have noticable speedups when using opaque pointers.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Better binary compatibility
  
  
    <p>If you decide to add another member to the string structure containing
    information about the number of reallocations, because you want to find the
    optimum initial string size for a certain application, you can do so, but if
    client code directly accessed the size and offset information of the
    structure, all such code needs to be recompiled. This is inofficially called
    
      <em>ABI breakage</em>.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h3>Disadvantages

</h3> <p>This all sounds great and we may ask ourselves, why doesn't everybody
encapsulate everything. There are also disadvantages to be considered when
designing software.

</p> <ul>
  <li>Speed
  
  
    <p>This is probably the most considered and least important disadvantage. I say
    most considered, because people often tend to ignore good practice and
    prematurely optimise their code by not encapsulating data properly. Consider
    the code required to access a member of a structure directly and the code
    required to call a function doing the same thing. A member access is a full
    word addition and a dereference on x86 platforms. A function call is at least
    a full word decrement, four unconditional moves, two stack pushes, a
    dereference, an addition, an increment, two stack pops, an unconditional jump
    and a call return. A lot more to do for our poor little Pentium with 3 GHz.
    
    </p>
    <p>But our poor little Pentium with 3 GHz will do all that within 70 clock
    cycles, which is about 10 cycles more than a 
      <code>nop</code> instruction. This is why I
    say, it is the least important disadvantage. If you are writing speed
    critical, embedded software or real-time applications, you will ignore this,
    but then you will also ignore any other principles known to be good practice.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Code bloat
  
  
    <p>The above argument indirectly contains the code bloat argument. All those
    instructions needed to call a function returning or setting the member's value
    exist in object code after compilation. If you have a large structure with
    accessors for each member, you will substantially increase code size. Modern
    computers will gladly handle large binaries, so this is an argument for
    embedded developers only.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Dynamic allocation
  
  
    <p>In the case of opaque pointers, all objects need to be allocated on the free
    store (using 
      <code>malloc</code>), There are situations in which this is not viable, for
    example in embedded systems such as mp3 players, In certain environments, the
    use of 
      <code>malloc</code> is either prohibited due to its nondeterministic nature with
    regards to operation time or simply not implemented. In this case, the
    structure needs to be visible in all locations where it is allocated, so a
    macro such as the following might help:
    
    
    </p>
    <pre class="verbatim">#define MEW_LOCAL(TYPE, NAME) TYPE NAME##_; TYPE *NAME = NAME##_</pre>
    <p>Or one could just declare the variable locally and pass its address to its
    operations,
    
    </p>
    <p>In addition to that, one could name all members "
      <code>membername_</code>" (trailing
    underscore) in order to be able to easily spot violations of the principle,
    visually. It also makes the author of client code think twice.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
</ul> <h3>The compromise

</h3> <p>In C, there are a few ways to speed up and shrink the code without violating
information hiding. One of these is the use of macros. Instead of defining a
function:

</p> <pre class="verbatim">size_t strLength (ConstString str);</pre> <p>we define a macro doing the same:

</p> <pre class="verbatim">#define strLength(s)  (s)-&gt;len</pre> <p>This has disadvantages, as well. Now, you cannot use opaque pointers anymore,
no longer avoiding ABI breakages and speeding up incremental builds. It is no
longer type-safe, as you could pass any structure with a 
  <code>len</code> member to this
macro. It still avoids API breakages, though. This way, you can have some form
of encapsulation even in speed critical applications.


</p> <h3>Information hiding in other languages

</h3> <p>I chose C, as I said, because it is most suitable as example for
encapsulation. This does not mean that other languages do not have equally
good or even better ways to encapsulate data.

</p> <ul>
  <li>C++
  
  
    <p>has the 
      <em>pimpl</em> idiom. This idiom is basically the same as using opaque
    pointers in C, except that the accessor functions are wrapped in a class,
    making the code look more object oriented.
    
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Java
  
  
    <p>tends to make all variables private and provide getters and setters for each
    of them. C has no notion of private, protected or public. These modifiers make
    the code look even more object oriented. Due to the fact that Java has no
    references in the C++ sense, accessors cannot be made as natural as in C# or
    C++.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>C#
  
  
    <p>has properties, which syntactically behave exactly like public member
    variables, but in fact execute small (or large) portions of code to validate
    input or invoke events on modification.
    
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Perl
  
  
    <p>Perl's objects are references 
      <code>bless</code>ed into a package. This means that all
    methods called on the object are looked up in that package. Most common
    references are hash references, allowing named data members.
    
      <code>$ob-&gt;{member}</code> is a way to access this data, but it is discouraged.
    Instead, methods are used: 
      <code>$ob-&gt;method</code>.
