			<h2>Qt Word Trainer

</h2> <p>QVoc is a simple word trainer written in C++/Qt.

</p> <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/pippijn/gvoc">Git repository</a>


</p> <p>It was specifically designed for learning Chinese, because I don't need any more
than that, at the moment.  Modifying it to support other languages and word
lists is trivial. By keeping it simple, QVoc has a neglegible startup time and
can therefore be started anytime you want to study your foreign language.

</p> <h3>Using QVoc

</h3> <p>After loading the word lists, which are the Chinese word lists for the HSK level
1 and 2 exams, the words are shuffled and you will be confronted with a Chinese
word along with its pinyin (phonetic alphabet for Chinese characters).  The
trainer will expect you to write the English translation. The word lists have a
set of acceptable solutions, so for a word such as Â (s√¨), acceptable solutions
might be "4" or "four". The solution is case insensitive.

</p> <div class="centered-image">
  <div>
    <img alt="Using" src="images/initial.png" />
  </div>Using
</div> <p>You can choose to switch to English, after which point you will be presented an
English word to be translated to Chinese. You may either enter pinyin or Chinese
characters. Special phonetics are ignored, such that you may enter "si" instead
of "s√¨" when asked about "four".

</p> <div class="centered-image">
  <div>
    <img alt="English" src="images/english.png" />
  </div>English
</div> <p>After entering the correct translation, you get one point and the word will not
be asked in the next round. If you make a mistake, the word will be asked for
the next three rounds. If you don't know the answer, you can skip the question
by requesting an answer using the 
  <code>Answer</code> button or by hitting the return key
without entering anything. The word is then marked as "skipped" and will be
asked again, next time. Note that you can switch to English and back to get the
solution, as well, if you want to cheat, but do note that this harms only you
and nobody else (I have this much discipline, so I didn't bother protecting
myself against cheating).


</p> <div class="centered-image">
  <div>
    <img alt="Doing" src="images/mistake.png" />
  </div>Doing
</div> <p>Some words also have a hint attached to them. You may click the 
  <code>Hint</code> button
at no cost.


</p> <div class="centered-image">
  <div>
    <img alt="Hints" src="images/hint.png" />
  </div>Hints
</div> <p>There may also be more than one hint for a single word. If you still don't know
the answer after the first hint, you may click the 
  <code>Hint</code> button again. Hints
are not random, so you can cycle through them.


</p> <div class="centered-image">
  <div>
    <img alt="Multiple" src="images/hint2.png" />
  </div>Multiple
</div> <p>When all words have been asked, a report will be displayed. This report will
always be measure percentages with respect to the last cycle. Thus, the second
cycle may have a dramatically worse score, because you will be asked the words
you didn't know the first time.

</div> <h3>About the implementation

</h3> <h4>Word and hint lists

</h4> <p>In order to keep the implementation simple, QVoc does not use a configuration
file. Instead, the application constructor contains an array of word list file
names, currently at 
  <code>["hsk1.txt", "hsk2.txt"]</code>. The word lists have the
following format:


</p> <pre>   # comments start with #
   # Chinese word,         pinyin,        primary translation; secondary translations
   ÂÆ∂,                     jiƒ,           home
   ‰∏,                     sh√†ng,         up; on; on top of
   ‰∏,                     xi√†,           down; under; below

</pre> <p>The hints are stored in a single file called 
  <code>"hints.txt"</code> with the following
format:


</p> <pre>   # comments again start with #
   # Chinese word, hint text, hint text in pinyin
   Ê¨¢Ëø
   ,       Ê¨¢ËøÊ•‰∏Êµ∑„
   ,       huƒny√≠ng l√°i sh√†ngh«i.

</pre> <pre>   # You may add more hints to a single word by repeating the word:
   Ê¨¢Ëø
   ,       Ê¨¢Ëø‰Ω†‰ª¨Ê•Âæ∑ÂΩ„
   ,       huƒny√≠ng n«men l√°i d√©gu√≥.

</pre> <p>The files are line- and comma-based. In the current implementation, that means
that in the word lists, the Chinese word is the text until the first comma, the
pinyin is the text until the second comma and the English translations are the
text after the second comma and before a newline. The hints file is read
analogously.

</p> <h4>Mistakes and skipped words

</h4> <p>A mistake will cause the word to be asked again for the next three cycles. A
skipped word is asked once in the next round. I decided not to weigh words with
many mistakes more heavily. I also decided not to delete known words from the
list, because repetition is a good thing, even for words you do know. After all
words have been correctly entered (some of them 3 times), the word list is
shuffled and all words are asked again.
