			<h2>Build system
</h2> <p>This document describes the Aldor build process, i.e. the Makefiles and
scripts used to build the supporting tools, the Aldor compiler, and its
libraries.
</p> <p>First of all, it should be noted that in general, convention is chosen over
flexibility. The directory structure requirements are rather strict, in order
to impose a common pattern on all library authors. This pattern can then be
used by scripts and automated tools to perform actions with little or no
configuration.
</p> <h3>Compiler
</h3> <p>The Aldor compiler has a layered design (see structure.md for more details).
This layering is represented in the build process by putting the object files
(.o) for each layer in a separate convenience library (.a/.lib file). In
general, code from one layer should not use code from a layer above it, and
not include headers from that layer. Currently, this is violated in several
instances.
</p> <p>The compiler is written in C and uses a LALR(1) macro-grammar to generate its
parser. The tool 
  <code>zacc</code> in 
  <code>aldor/tools/unix</code> expands macros in 
  <code>axl.z</code> and
produces 
  <code>axl_y.c</code> by calling 
  <code>yacc</code> on the expanded grammar.

</p> <p>Compiler messages databases are generated by 
  <code>aldor/tools/unix/msgcat</code>, which
produces 
  <code>comsgdb.c</code> and 
  <code>comsgdb.h</code> from 
  <code>comsgdb.msg</code>.

</p> <h3>Libraries
</h3> <p>The structure of an Aldor library follows a pattern:
</p> <ul>
  <li>Makefile.am:          Dispatches into include, src and test.
  </li>
  <li>include:              Aldor header files installed along with the library.
  </li>
  <li>Makefile.am:        Installs Aldor header files.
  </li>
  <li>src:                  Aldor and C code for the library.
  </li>
  <li>Makefile.am:        Dispatches sub-library builds and builds main library.
  </li>
  <li>common.mk:          Common variables for all sub-libraries.
  </li>
  <li>*/:                Subdirs containing Aldor sources.
  </li>
  <li>test:                 Test programs for the library.
  </li>
  <li>Makefile.am:        List of test programs and their expected outcome.
  </li>
  <li>*/:                Subdirs containing test program sources.
  </li>
</ul> <p>Other subdirectories can be added, but the build scripts expect at least the
three above to exist. By convention, we recommend the following names for
optional directories:
</p> <ul>
  <li>doc:                  Library documentation, usually in LaTeX form.
  </li>
  <li>tools:                Extra programs, not installed with the library, but
                      used to generate sources or perform more complex build
                      tasks. These must be built 
    <em>before</em> 
    <code>src</code>.
  
  </li>
  <li>utility:              Extra programs built for and/or with the library. Must
                      be built 
    <em>after</em> 
    <code>src</code>.
  
  </li>
</ul> <p>The following is a high level view of the library build. A more in-depth
explanation of what the build scripts and helpers do will follow in another
section.
</p> <h4>Root: Makefile.am
</h4> <p>The root Makefile.am should be mostly empty, and only dispatch into
sub-directories. For most complete libraries with documentation, it will look
similar to this:
</p> <pre class="code-block">SUBDIRS = doc include src test</pre> <h4>Sources: src/Makefile.am
</h4> <p>Each Aldor library consists of one or more sub-libraries that are built in
dependency order. This order must be stated explicitly in the source

  <code>src/Makefile.am</code> for the library by listing them in the 
  <code>SUBDIRS</code> variable.

</p> <pre class="code-block">SUBDIRS = part1 part2</pre> <p>Second in the Automake file should be the file name of the library being
built. We call our demo library here 
  <code>libsample.a</code>.

</p> <pre class="code-block">lib_LIBRARIES = libsample.a</pre> <p>After this, we list all the C sources, including those generated from Aldor
code. Extra support code for the C side should also be listed in this
variable. The variable name is the above library name with non-alphanumeric
characters such as 
  <code>-</code> and 
  <code>.</code> replaced by underscores 
  <code>_</code>.

</p> <pre class="code-block">libsample_a_SOURCES =   \
        part1/doma.c    \
        part1/domb.c    \
        part2/domc.c    \
        part2/domd.c    \
        #</pre> <p>Note that Automake does not accept trailing backslashes, so you may either end
the list with a comment or omit the last backslash. The order of this list is
irrelevant, as there are no dependencies between these files; they can be
built in parallel.
</p> <h5>Library name
</h5> <p>Next, the library name must be repeated without the 
  <code>lib</code> prefix and the 
  <code>.a</code>
suffix. This name must be equal to the current directory. I.e. if the file you
are creating is 
  <code>lib/sample/Makefile.am</code>, then 
  <code>libraryname</code> must be 
  <code>sample</code>.
This name is used to build the Aldor side of the library, i.e. the .al file,
in this case 
  <code>libsample.al</code>.

</p> <pre class="code-block">libraryname = sample</pre> <p>Due to Automake limitations, it is not possible to use 
  <code>$(libraryname)</code> in the
definition of 
  <code>lib_LIBRARIES</code>.

</p> <p>Often, the headers provided by and included in the library being built contain
code that is conditionalised on whether they are used to build the library or
they are being used to build code against a completed library. The reason for
this is that the header will import the Aldor Library (.al file) automatically
when you include it in client code, but while building the library, this file
does not yet exist.
</p> <p>By default, the symbol defined by the build system that tells the header
whether it is currently being built is named 
  <code>Build</code> followed by the
capitalised 
  <code>$(libraryname)</code> and 
  <code>Lib</code>, so that in our case, the symbol would
be 
  <code>BuildSampleLib</code>. If you want to override the name between 
  <code>Build</code> and

  <code>Lib</code>, you must define 
  <code>Libraryname</code>.

</p> <p>E.g.:
</p> <pre class="code-block">Libraryname = Demo</pre> <p>will define 
  <code>BuildDemoLib</code>, and not 
  <code>BuildSampleLib</code> while compiling Aldor
code for this library.

</p> <h5>Default Makefile
</h5> <p>Most libraries will want to include the default Automake rule file that
produces and installs the Aldor library. This file resides in the 
  <code>lib</code> under
the 
  <code>aldor</code> build root.

</p> <pre class="code-block">include ../../buildlib.am</pre> <p>Usually, this will be the last line of your 
  <code>src/Makefile.am</code>. Other rules and
variables can follow it. The following variables are defined by 
  <code>buildlib.am</code>,
and thus additions to them must be done with 
  <code>+=</code>.

</p> <ul>
  <li>
    <code>datalibdir</code>:         Installation directory for 
    <code>.al</code> file.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>datalib_DATA</code>:       Files to be installed into 
    <code>$(datalibdir)</code>.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>aldorsrcdir</code>:        Aldor compiler source directory with runtime headers.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>aldorexedir</code>:        Contains built Aldor compiler binary 
    <code>aldor</code>.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>AM_CFLAGS</code>:          C compiler flags.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>CLEANFILES</code>:         Removes the 
    <code>.al</code> file on 
    <code>make clean</code>.
  
  </li>
</ul> <h5>Extra files
</h5> <p>The library is automatically installed in the appropriate place for the Aldor
compiler to be able to find it with 
  <code>#library</code>. If you would like to install
other files in the same directory, 

</p> <h4>Sub-libraries: src/*/Makefile.in
</h4> <p>A sub-library Makefile is not an Automake file, but rather a simple Makefile
preprocessed by 
  <code>config.status</code>, generated by 
  <code>configure</code>. It starts with a
common boilerplate that is required since we're not using Automake here, but
we want to be integrated with the Automake-based build.

</p> <p>(TODO: move this to an extra file in the same directory (perhaps

  <code>prelude.mk.in</code>), so it can be updated automatically)

</p> <pre class="code-block">@SET_MAKE@
VPATH = @srcdir@

# For AM_V_*
AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY = @AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY@

builddir        := @builddir@
abs_builddir    := @abs_builddir@
top_builddir    := @top_builddir@
abs_top_builddir:= @abs_top_builddir@
srcdir          := @srcdir@
abs_srcdir      := @abs_srcdir@
top_srcdir      := @top_srcdir@
abs_top_srcdir  := @abs_top_srcdir@</pre> <p>The boilerplate is followed by a list of Aldor source files without the 
  <code>.as</code>
suffix.

</p> <pre class="code-block">library = doma domb</pre> <p>Lastly, the common build variables for the library are included. A relative
path using explicit 
  <code>../..</code> should not be used, as that would break vpath (out
of tree) builds.

</p> <pre class="code-block">include $(top_srcdir)/lib/sample/src/common.mk</pre> <h5>src/common.am
</h5> <p>The purpose of this extraction is to minimise reduncancy by defining common
variables only once. The only required variable in this file is 
  <code>libraryname</code>,
whose purpose was described in the earlier section "Library name".

</p> <pre class="code-block">libraryname     := sample</pre> <p>Commonly, libraries will want to define their Aldor optimisation and debug
flags, more generally speaking its compiler flags.
</p> <pre class="code-block">AXLFLAGS        := -Q8 -Zdb</pre> <p>Finally, at the end of a library's 
  <code>common.mk</code>, the main build machinery for
Aldor sub-libraries is included.

</p> <pre class="code-block">include $(top_srcdir)/lib/buildlib.mk</pre> <p>This file is always included, unless you have very specific needs, which
require you to completely define your own. We recommend against this, and
rather file a feature request describing your special needs. Although our
design is purposefully inflexible and based on convention, we do want to be
able to build any kind of Aldor library.
</p> <h5>src/*/Makefile.deps
</h5> <p>Next to each 
  <code>Makefile.in</code> in a sub-library's directory, a dependency file is
required. We are unfortunately unable to correctly generate these from the
sources, for now, since it requires us to preprocess the Aldor sources with
the same flags used during the build.

</p> <p>For each source name 
  <code>dom</code> listed in 
  <code>library</code> above, there is an optional

  <code>dom_deps</code>, containing its dependencies within the sub-library. If the
sub-library itself depends on another sub-library from the same combined
library, these should be listed in 
  <code>library_deps</code>.

</p> <p>(TODO: this is bad, it reserves the source name 
  <code>library.as</code>)

</p> <p>The following fragment might be for part2 of our sample library, which depends
on part1, and in which 
  <code>domd</code> depends on 
  <code>domc</code>. Note that although files in
part2 may depend on files in part1, these dependencies are not listed
explicitly, but rather the complete part1 is imported.

</p> <pre class="code-block"># Intra-sublib dependencies
domd_deps       := domc

# Sublib dependencies
library_deps    := part1</pre> <h4>Testing
</h4> <p>Libraries are tested using test programs whose return value signals the
success or failure of a test. Each program with name 
  <code>$P</code> is in its own
subdirectory 
  <code>$P</code> with an Aldor source file 
  <code>$P/$P.as</code> and an output reference
file 
  <code>$P/$P.ref</code>. Each test directory also contains a 
  <code>.gitignore</code> file of
this format:

</p> <pre class="code-block">/$P
/$P.c
/$P-aldormain.c</pre> <p>Makefile.am contains a list of libraries required for the tests, a list of
test directories, a list of tests known to fail, and an include directive for
the common test code.
</p> <pre class="code-block">libraries = aldor sample

AXLTESTS =              \
        domatest1       \
        domatest2       \

another.
