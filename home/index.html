Home</h2>

Welcome to my homepage. The initial version of this was produced as part of a
first semester task at the University for Applied Sciences in Karlsruhe, where I
did my bachelor's and am currently pursuing a master's degree. Since then, it
has received some major and several minor overhauls, but I don't spend a lot of
time documenting my activities the way others do in their blogs and other online
presences. At some point, I documented some of my projects, but since then, new
ones have been started that are not represented on this site. They will be added
when I am having another documentation spree.</p>
<p>
This site is now the home of some of my projects, articles (some of which I have
been asked to write and some of which are no longer accessible via the menu,
because they are severely out of date or no longer reflect my opinions). On the
page you are reading now, I will try to say a few words about who I am and what
I do.</p>
<p>
My passion is computer science. My main fields of interest are programming
languages, compilers and the formalisms and implementations behind them. I enjoy
thinking about how to express ideas in understandable and semantically rich ways
and like to design domain specific languages that enable one to do that.</p>
<p>
I am also forced to think about build system design, as I have been unable to
find a build system that meets my needs, but it is not my main academic
interest.</p>
<p>
At the moment, my languages of choice for most tasks are OCaml, C++ and Perl.
Knowledge of OCaml is my most recent acquisition and is not very deep, yet, but
some of my projects are written in it and I plan on using it more.</p>
